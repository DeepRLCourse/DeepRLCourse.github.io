    <h1>404: Agent Lost in Exploration!</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Oops! 😅</strong>
        It seems our RL agent got a little too curious and wandered off into uncharted territory.
        <br>
        Don't worry, it's still exploring the state space, trying to maximize its reward (and failing miserably).
    </p>
    <h3>Here's what you can do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="javascript:location.reload();" class="button">Press F5! 🔄</a>
            <span>Give the agent another chance to find the optimal policy.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/" class="button">Go Back to Homepage! 🏠</a>
            <span>Maybe the agent will follow your lead and learn by imitation.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="button">Wait! ⏳</span>
            <span>The agent is probably stuck in a local minimum. It'll figure it out… eventually.</span>

            <strong>RL Breakup Joke: 🤖💔</strong>
            <br>
            Why did the RL agent break up with the supervised learning model?
            <br>
            Because it said, "I need more exploration, not just exploitation!" 😁
        </p>
        <p class="context">(The RL agent loves trying new things, while the supervised model just sticks to the labels it knows!)</p>
