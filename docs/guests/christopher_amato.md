# Christopher Amato

### About

Christopher Amato is an Associate Professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, where he leads the Lab for Learning and Planning in Robotics. His research advances planning and reinforcement learning for systems operating under uncertainty—especially multi-agent and multi-robot environments with partial observability—and has earned recognition such as the Best Paper Prize at AAMAS 2014 and nominations at RSS 2015, AAAI 2019, and AAMAS 2021 ([khoury.northeastern.edu][1]). Prior to Northeastern, he was a research scientist and postdoctoral fellow at MIT and served as an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire. Holding a Ph.D. from UMass Amherst, Amato has made significant theoretical and practical contributions to decentralized POMDPs and macro-action frameworks, and his work—covering multi-robot coordination, navigation, surveillance, and game-playing AI—has been featured in outlets like MIT News and Wired.
