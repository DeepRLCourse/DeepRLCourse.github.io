# Game Theory

## Basic Concepts
### Players, Strategies, and Payoffs
- Definition of players, strategies, and payoff matrices
- Normal-form and extensive-form games
- Applications in RL (e.g., multi-agent environments)

### Nash Equilibrium
- Definition and intuition
- Pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria
- Applications in RL (e.g., equilibrium strategies in multi-agent RL)

### Zero-Sum and Non-Zero-Sum Games
- Zero-sum games: Minimax theorem and saddle points
- Non-zero-sum games: Cooperation and competition
- Applications in RL (e.g., adversarial training, self-play)

## Multi-Agent Interactions
### Cooperative Settings
- Definition and examples of cooperative games
- Coalition formation and Shapley value
- Applications in RL (e.g., cooperative multi-agent RL)

### Competitive Settings
- Definition and examples of competitive games
- Best response strategies and dominance
- Applications in RL (e.g., competitive multi-agent RL)

### Pareto Optimality and Social Welfare
- Definition of Pareto efficiency
- Social welfare and fairness in multi-agent systems
- Applications in RL (e.g., reward shaping, fairness in multi-agent RL)

## Advanced Topics
### Repeated Games
- Definition and strategies (e.g., tit-for-tat, grim trigger)
- Folk theorems and long-term equilibria
- Applications in RL (e.g., repeated interactions in multi-agent RL)

### Bayesian Games
- Definition and incomplete information
- Bayesian Nash equilibrium
- Applications in RL (e.g., partially observable multi-agent environments)

### Mechanism Design
- Definition and goal of mechanism design
- Incentive compatibility and revelation principle
- Applications in RL (e.g., designing reward mechanisms for multi-agent systems)
